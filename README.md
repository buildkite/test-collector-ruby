**DEPRECATION NOTICE**
Versions prior to 2.1.x are unsupported and will not work after mid-2023. Please upgrade to the latest version.

Official [Buildkite Test Engine](https://buildkite.com/platform/test-engine) collectors for Ruby test frameworks ✨

⚒ **Supported test frameworks:** RSpec, Minitest, Cucumber, and [more coming soon](https://github.com/buildkite/test-collector-ruby/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22test+frameworks%22).

📦 **Supported CI systems:** Buildkite, GitHub Actions, CircleCI, Codeship, and others via the `BUILDKITE_ANALYTICS_*` environment variables.

## 👉 Installing

### Step 1

[Create a test suite](https://buildkite.com/docs/test-analytics), and copy the API token that it gives you.

Add the [`buildkite-test_collector`](https://rubygems.org/gems/buildkite-test_collector) gem:

```shell
gem install buildkite-test_collector
```

Or add this to your Gemfile’s test group:

```ruby
group :test do
  gem 'buildkite-test_collector'
end
```

### Step 2

#### RSpec

Add the following code to your RSpec setup file:

```ruby
# spec/spec_helper.rb
require 'buildkite/test_collector'
Buildkite::TestCollector.configure(hook: :rspec)
```

Run your tests locally:

```shell
BUILDKITE_ANALYTICS_TOKEN=xyz rspec
```

#### Minitest

Add the following code to your Minitest setup file:

```ruby
# test/test_helper.rb
require 'buildkite/test_collector'
Buildkite::TestCollector.configure(hook: :minitest)
```

Run your tests locally:

```shell
BUILDKITE_ANALYTICS_TOKEN=xyz rake
```

#### Cucumber

Add the following code to your Cucumber setup file:

```ruby
# features/support/env.rb
require 'buildkite/test_collector'
Buildkite::TestCollector.configure(hook: :cucumber)
```

Run your tests locally:

```shell
BUILDKITE_ANALYTICS_TOKEN=xyz cucumber
```

### Step 3

Add the `BUILDKITE_ANALYTICS_TOKEN` secret to your CI, push your changes to a branch, and open a pull request 🎉
